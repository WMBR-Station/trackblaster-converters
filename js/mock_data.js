You're, uh, you're probably here about the, uh, the story. Elves love to tell stories. I-I'll bet you didn't know that about elves. There's, uh, probably a lot of things you... you didn't know about elves. Another... another interesting uh, 'elf-ism', uh, there are only three jobs available to an elf. The first is making shoes at night while, you know, while the old... The old cobbler sleeps.\n\nTwo ELVES hammering away at a pile of shoes as a fat shoemaker sleeps with a copy of \"Hot Cobbler\" magazine on his chest, a busty cobbler lady on the cover.\n\nDISGRUNTLED COBBLER ELF: Lazy bum. Couldn't even make a clog.\n\nYou can bake cookies\n\nIn a tree. Hey!\n\nAs you can imagine, it's, uh, dangerous Having an oven\n\nIn an oak tree during the dry season.\n\n[Screaming] I wanna make shoes!\n\nBut the third job... uh, some call It, uh,\n\n\"The show,\" or... or \"the big dance,\"\n\nIt's the profession that every elf Aspires to,\n\nAnd that is to build toys in Santa's workshop.\n\nOnly two weeks left till Christmas!\n\nI-It's a job only an elf can do.\n\nOur... our nimble fingers,\n\nNatural cheer and active minds\n\nAre perfect for toy-building.\n\nThey... they tried using gnomes And trolls,\n\nBut the gnomes drank too much...\n\n...and the trolls weren't toilet trained.\n\nNo human being has ever set... set foot in Santa's workshop.\n\nUh, that is until about 30 years ago,\n\nAnd, as you may have guessed,\n\nThat's where our story begins.\n\nWow!\n\nWhoa!\n\nOoh!\n\nWow!\n\nWow!\n\n[Humming]\n\nOw! Ow!\n\nWhoa!\n\nAre you sleepy?\n\nHere we are.\n\nWe're just going to make you feel so comfortable.\n\nHere we are.\n\nThere you are.\n\nIt's time to go to sleep.\n\nMaybe by next Christmas you'll Have a home.\n\nMerry Christmas, my angel.\n\n[Creaking]\n\n[Santa:] Mmm...\n\n[Bars clang]\n\n[Cheering music playing]\n\nAll right, all right.\n\nWe've had another very successful year.\n\n[Cheering]\n\nSo, after all that hard work,\n\nIt's time to start preparations\n\nFor next Christmas!\n\n[Cheering]\n\nWhat in the name of Sam hill Is that?\n\n[Elves:] Wow...\n\n[Male elf:] A baby...\n\n[Elf:] \"little buddy diapers.\"\n\nHis name is buddy. He must've...\n\nSnuck into your sack at the orphanage.\n\nWhat do we do?\n\n[Papa Elf:] So, Santa had a Decision to make,\n\nAnd fortunately, when it Comes to babies,\n\nSanta's a... a pushover.\n\nSo, buddy stayed with, uh An older elf\n\nWho had always wanted a child?\n\nBut had been so committed to Building toys, he...\n\nHe, well, had forgotten to Settle down.\n\nSanta.\n\nYes, yes, I... I raised buddy.\n\nI was his adopted father.\n\nThough buddy grew twice as fast,\n\nHe... he wasn't any different from the other children.\n\nChuckles not too fast, buddy.\n\nI mean, not... not really.\n\nBefore we learn how to build The latest\n\nIn extreme graphic chipset Processors,\n\nLet's recite the \"Code of the elves,\"\n\nShall we?\n\nNumber one.\n\n\"Treat every day like Christmas.\"\n\nNumber two.\n\n\"There's room for everyone on the Nice list.\"\n\nNumber three.\n\n\"The best way to spread Christmas Cheer\n\nIs singing loud for all to hear.\"\n\nAnd one day, when buddy was old enough,\n\nI made him my own personal apprentice.\n\nI've never been in this room before.\n\nWell, I think it's time you start\n\nYour tinker training.\n\n[Gasps] Santa's sleigh.\n\nYou're gonna help me make it fly.\n\nI thought the magical reindeer made The sleighs fly.\n\nAnd where do the reindeer get their magic from?\n\nChristmas spirit.

Walter, this is...\n\nThis is wonderful,\n\nYou... you have another son.\n\nWonderful. Oh, gosh, I...\n\nI guess I never really thought of it that way.\n\nThis is incredible, I...\n\nYou know, it's a little complicated,\n\nBut it's nothing that we can't handle.\n\nHoney? What?\n\nHe thinks he's an elf.\n\nI'm sorry, what?\n\nHe think she's a Christmas elf.\n\nOh, come on, Walter,\n\nI'm sure he doesn't actually think he's an elf.\n\nAnd then, I traveled through the seven levels\n\nOf the candy cane forest,\n\nPast the sea of swirly-twirly gumdrops,\n\nAnd then, I walked through the Lincoln tunnel.\n\nAhh.\n\nSo, where were you for the last 30 years?\n\nThe north pole.\n\nCan you pass the maple syrup?

Can I just speak to you for a minute\n\nin the, uh, kitchen, please?\n\nAre you crazy? He cannot stay here.\n\nClearly he has some serious issues.\n\nWe can't just throw him out in the snow.\n\nWhy not? He loves the snow.\n\nHe's told me 15 times.\n\nWalter, he's your son.\n\n[Belching]\n\nDid you hear that?\n\nYou are so weird.\n\nDad?\n\nDad?\n\nDad!
